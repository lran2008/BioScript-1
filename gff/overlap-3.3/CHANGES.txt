Bug Fixes
---------

- Fix for the -m mode option for defining the kind of overlap information one wants to retrieve 
  about file2 features overlapping file1 features.
  When using mode=n where n>=10 and n is even, the (key,value) pairs provided in the output gff 
  files are now correctly ordered.

Internal
--------

- The file1 is now first sorted using the Unix sort program, in order to avoid memory problems

- Now handles stack overflow and out of memory errors explicitly
