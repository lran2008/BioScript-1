SYNOPSIS
    Given an untrimmed .fastq-illumina file of small RNA sequencing data,
    and the sequence of a known, highly abundant microRNA, identify all
    reads containing that microRNA, and track the apparent 3' adapters.
    Report the top four adapter sequences found. Usually the most abundant
    one is the 'true' sequence of the 3' adapter used to create the library.

INSTALL
    ensure the script is executable

        chmod +x find_3p_adapter.pl

    ensure the script is in your PATH (examples):

        sudo cp find_3p_adapter.pl /usr/bin/

    OR just for one session assuming script is in your working directory:

        PATH=$PATH:.
    
    ensure 'perl' is located in /usr/bin/ .. if not, edit line 1 of script
    accordingly

USAGE
    usage for fastq.gz compressed files:

        gzip -d -c [input.fastq.gz] | find_3p_adapter.pl -m [miRNA_sequence]

    usage for uncompressed .fastq files:

        find_3p_adapter.pl -m [miRNA_sequence] < [input.fastq]

    Output goes to STDERR

OPTIONS
    All options are required to be supplied by the user

    -m : sequence of a known microRNA that is abundant in your dataset,
    5'-3', only ACTGUactgu characters allowed

NOTES
  Choice of microRNA

    Hopefully you know the sequence of a few microRNAs that should be highly
    abundant in your sample. In plants, I routinely use ath-miR156a,
    ath-miR166a, and ath-miR390a, as they are all highly conserved and often
    highly expressed in most samples.

VERSIONS
    0.1 : Unreleased internal version

    0.2 : This version .. fastq input as stream to enable use with
    compressed files, documentation added. March 9, 2012
